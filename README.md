# lc3-vm-rust

## What the project is

This project implements an **LC-3 virtual machine in Rust**, using the *Write your own virtual machine* article as a reference. The goal is to build a functional VM with its opcodes and memory model, keeping the code simple and without over-engineering, and able to run the roguelike from the terminal.

## What problem it solves

It allows running LC-3 programs in a modern, safe Rust environment, respecting the opcode set and memory model of the architecture, with a focus on real integration (opcodes working together in complete programs) rather than isolated tests.

## How to build, run, and test

To be defined. This section is pending specifications.
